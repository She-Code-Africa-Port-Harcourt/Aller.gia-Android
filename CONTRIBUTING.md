# Your First Contribution
**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://kcd.im/pull-request).
At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first. 😸

# Getting Started
### Opening an issue
Feel free to open an issue if you notice a bug or a missing feature. To help us prevent duplicates, we kindly ask that you briefly search for your problem or question in our issues before opening a new one.
Please note that if you open a bug report, we cannot help you until you have provided us with all the relevant information. Respectfully, we do not have the time to try and recreate an error given with minimal or no context, so by providing this information you are helping us help you! Provide descriptions to the best of your ability, and please include screenshots and error logs if applicable.

### Fixing an issue
If you would like to fix an existing issue, leave a comment on it to indicate. This is to avoid having several people unknowingly working on the same issue.

## Contributing to the source code

1. Fork and clone this repo.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/She-Code-Africa-Port-Harcourt/Aller.gia.git
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/She-Code-Africa-Port-Harcourt/Aller.gia.git
```
2. Create a new branch from the develop branch

```
$ cd dev
$ git checkout -b dev-my-new-branch

```

3. Pick an issue or create one
4. Declare your interest to work on an issue and get assigned
5. Start working on it
6. Commit the change(s) with a descriptive commit message and push to your fork. PS: here's a guide for [writing good commit messages](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/). 
```
$ git add .
$ git commit -s -m "descriptive commit message"
$ git push -u origin my-new-branch
```
 
7. Submit a pull request. We encourage you to write tests if you can.

At this point, you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests as soon as possible. Once the maintainer has had a chance to review your PR, we will either mark it as "hacktoberfest-accepted" and provide specific feedback on your changes, or we will go ahead and complete the pull request and merge.

To ensure all your commits are signed, you have to configure git properly by editing your global .gitconfig
```
$ git config --global user.name "godswillpanda" 
$ git config --global user.email hodswillpanda@example.com

```
